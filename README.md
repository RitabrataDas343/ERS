Hey remember, I have not included node_modules,you need to get it yourself. If you don't know, how to get them,follow the steps under **First-things-to-Do**.

## Requirements
- You require a browser,and a working terminal.
- Node.js should be installed.
- There are many resources, from which you can learn how to install Node.js.
    
## First-things-to-Do
After downloading the Repo, and having everything of the **Requirements** follow the following steps:
- Get node_modules folder by running the following command
```sh
